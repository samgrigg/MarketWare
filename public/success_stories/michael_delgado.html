<h6>Success with MarketWare</h6>

<p>Michael Delgado, Southeast Missouri Hospital</p>

<p>Michael Delgado, Senior Manager of Business Development at Southeast Missouri Hospital, had the responsibility to purchase a Customer Relationship Management system to manage the relationships of his referring physicians.</p>

<p>While looking for a software solution he had three goals.</p>

<p>First: To find software he and his liaisons could easily use and one in which he could customize for his physician relations. He was able to accomplish his first goal when he came across MarketWare’s Physician Relationship Management system which is completely customized for Physician Relations.  </p>

<p>“We were able to tailor the software to meet our unique circumstances, and MarketWare Support has been quick to respond to any support request, including requests for database changes.”</p>

<p>Second: To find software with the flexibility his liaisons needed. Michael’s liaisons find themselves constantly on the road visiting physicians. He was looking for a CRM that could be accessed when his liaisons were on the road.</p>

<p>“We wanted a database program that allows us to have access to the database while we are out in the field.  With MarketWare’s ability to go ‘off-line’ we have the ability to enter information into MarketWare anywhere we have an internet connection or not.”  </p>

<p>Third:  Michael’s final goal was to find something that was affordable. He did not want to break the bank for a software program. He was able to find affordability with MarketWare. </p>

<p>Without third party distributors or extra costs for important features like offline views, MarketWare was the Physician Relationship Management program for Michael Delgado at Southeast Missouri Hospital. </p>
