<h5>Security</h5>
<p>This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, the information is protected both online and offline.</p>
<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. To learn more about SSL, follow this link: http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/S/SSL.html</p>
<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information offline. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to regain access to the information previously viewed. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our Customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that are used to store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.</p>
