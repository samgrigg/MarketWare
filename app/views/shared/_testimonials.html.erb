    <p>Marketware is a great program… I have used other programs like this, but it is the best I have come across for dependability and easy reporting&hellip;  I have very much enjoyed working with you and have found you to be accessible, flexible, and very knowledgeable about your product.</p>

    <p>One thing I noticed when we sat down for the one-on-one training. . . was that [the MarketWare Consultant] had a satchel of best practices drawn from years of observing how [ MarketWare] was used, which come across not as extra work as most best practices do, but as illuminations or 'aha!' moments.</p>
